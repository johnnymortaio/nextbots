## Features

### Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin

This bot does pretty much the same things that most simple bots out there already do.
But smiling when sending you to the gulag.

  * Hides in blind spots waiting for a player to enter his search area
  * Makes the player enjoy a [Red Army Choir masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgKazTrhXmI) while approaching
  * Chases the player until death by kicking you to the gulag occurs

### FARAOH

Same features as Stalin's Nextbot, but with an animated texture and multiple sounds shouted while chasing.
